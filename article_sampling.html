The doctrine of Mr. DARWIN had been enounced, in the course of the preceding Winter, long enough before the meeting of the Association, to have provoked discussion, both popular and scientific, in all parts of the world. Coming from one of the most accomplished and respected of living naturalists, as the result of twenty years of unrelaxing study, travel and experiment, it could not fail to command the attention of the whole scientific guild, and not for these reasons alone, but also because the doctrine was at once novel in itself, in conflict with established beliefs, and seemed to offer solutions for a thousand difficulties which beset theories currently received. Review, magazine and newspaper had in turn expressed their more or less enlightened opinions of the book; but to the great annual conference of British science popular expectation was directed, as the criterion of the real scientific value of the discovery. The Association, to the disappointment of everybody, adjourned without passing any judgment upon the subject; in fact, it was only noticed cursorily, as furnishing an opportunity for a Bishop of the English Church to denounce its heretical tendencies. This denunciation seems to have stifled discussion; and a theory, which, whether true or false, is destined to distinguish the current year in the history of natural science, has not even been recognized by the most imposing scientific body of the period....</i></div><div id="1860_science_1"><h3>Science and the Weather. <i>(1860-08-09)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1860/08/09/archives/science-and-the-weather.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:The meteorological characteristics of the present Summer bid fair to signalize it at least in the annals of Mr. MERIAM.

We look to them for the reconciliation and alliance of theory and practice -- for the culture of unlettered ingenuity in the laws and history of Science, and the putting of a speaking tongue into the dumb mouth of Rule and Formula -- for restraining erratic genius within the limits of practicability, and clothing the impalpable spirit of Theory with a working body and iron arms -- that Science may no longer shine under a bushel, and that Practice may no longer grope in the uncertain light of instinct and limited experience. It is too late to restrict the learned professions to three; a fourth, delving at an equal depth into the great unknown, and revolutionizing the whole world with its benefits, has taken the foremost rank among the allies of civilization.

He commenced by saying that the average duration of human life depended upon the sanitary conditions which surrounded us -- the air we breathe, the food we eat, &amp;c. The health reports of Boston and Providence proved that those who lived in crowded tenements did not live so long by 20 years as those who lived in spacious and well-ventilated houses. The reports of Mr. CHADWICK, the English statistician, proved the same fact. The blood which is impelled through the system is constantly carrying off the decayed particles of the human organism, at the rate of from six to seven pounds daily, about three pounds of which is carbonic acid, and the remainder decomposed animal matter.

ROBBINS delivered a lecture last week at Clinton Hall, before an appreciative audience, on the operations of air, light and costume upon the health of the female sex. He advocated the improvement of woman's health as a certain means of improving the race. He found a great deal of fault with the costume of the ladies. He especially condemned the use of corsets, commenced as it was in the present age with infantile years, and quoted a celebrated English author to show that even a man, who, when not dressed could inhale 180 cubic inches of air in a given time, could, when dressed, inhale only 130 inches. And of course a greater proportionate difference was observable in women, by reason of their mode of dress. He contrasted the ravages of cholera with those of consumption, brought on by inattention to the laws of nature which he now sought to inculcate, and strengthened his argument by the statement that during the cholera season of 1849 there died in this City from that disease 31,506, while in the same year there died from consumption no less than 33,516. To show how much more than men women were, from there habits and mode of dress, liable to this disease, he asserted that in the same year (1849) 5,640 men died of consumption, while no less than 10,195 females were its victims. Of all the women who have died in the northeastern section of our country, more than one-half died of consumption, and those between the ages of fifteen and twenty years. The lecturer was particularly severe upon the subject of tight-lacing so especially prevalent among American ladies. He deprecated the practice of depriving girls of the air and exercise so necessary to health, which boys are permitted to partake of; and he was at a loss to know why such a difference should be made in the condition and habits of the sexes. Speaking of the higher classes, with special reference to our own City, he asserted that three-quarters of the young ladies of the upper and wealthier classes had some personal deformity, caused by this inattention to the most rational laws of health, or by an over-anxiety to reduce the circumference of the waist. The truth of his assertions was proved by a reference to the ancient Greeks, who, even now, after the lapse of centuries, were the models of form received by painters and sculptors; and he instanced also the Circassians and Georgians, who had never yet learned the mystery of corsets. Light, the lecturer contended, which was so much denied to women on account of their constant in-door confinement, was of the utmost importance in the development of health and strength. A plant or shrub grown in the shade never displayed the same amount of color or strength as those which enjoy the light of the Sun, and he claimed that if the ladies of this country would preserve health and retain their beauty, they must use more of air and sunlight. In England a woman was in the prime of her attractions at the age of 35, and gradually but beautifully faded away, while in this country at 25 a woman had reached her prime, and at 35 had begun to fade. He dwelt upon the responsibility of a mother. She must either be the giver of health, vitality, and strength or else the dispenser of disease and degeneration, and a knowledge of this fact should inculcate in woman a sense of her responsibility....</i></div><div id="1860_science_9"><h3>SCIENTIFIC BULLETIN.; Science in the Senate--Mineral Resources of Japan--The Telegraphy of Tempests--How Sap Ascends in Trees--Spontaneous Generation--Have Birds Teeth?--A Modest Savan--Science in America. <i>(1860-05-19)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1860/05/19/archives/scientific-bulletin-science-in-the-senatemineral-resources-of.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:When Senator IVERSON, of Georgia, last week opposed the resolution authorizing the employment of a vessel to transport five astronomers to some point where the solar eclipse of next July might be best observed, on the ground that he "could not see that the observation of the eclipse of the sun would enable ships to get into port any sooner," he gave utterance to a vulgar error unhappily not confined to the Senate of the United States.

One is in the South, the other in the Far West. As we penetrate into the former, the prospect becomes more dark and threatening, until at length the eye becomes weary with the gloom and confusion. The other becomes brighter as the eye traces beyond the foreground, and glimpses are got of a happy and industrious people, strong in their love of the Union, and everywhere laying the foundations of future wealth and greatness. That of the South presents us, just at this time, with a number of delirious men, perfectly conscious, not of yielding to a confessed weakness in their political system, but of wilfully misusing power, and committing a great wrong, simply because they had resolved to do it. Pride and fear, the two most dangerous offsprings of Slavery, find these men struggling with a despotism they will not ameliorate, and the downfall of which they blindly attempt to hasten, though it bring poverty and distress upon the whole people. There is nothing which so distinctly marks the boundaries between Freedom and Slavery as the peace, prosperity and intelligence seen on one side, and the poverty and confusion on the other. The line is as distinctly drawn as between Virtue and Vice. Freedom is progressive, Slavery retrogressive. The one represents those fearful inequalities of rank which take from the masses their rights, and give the wealth of the country to a few; which doom multitudes of our race, without fault of theirs, to hopeless, merciless suffering; sets their highest rights at defiance, denies their most sacred relations, lacerates their affections, and consigns them to a degradation on a level with the animal....</i></div><div id="1861_Minneapolis_2"><h3>PERSONAL. <i>(1861-01-31)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1861/01/31/archives/personal.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:-- Mr. and Mrs. Kimball, formerly residents of Syracuse, (N.Y.,) passed through Cleveland (Ohio) on Jan. 26, and they had a strange story to tell of their experiences since they left their home in 1848 to go to California, by the Overland route.

The scope of his argument remains without alteration. Mr. BAZLEY believes that England cannot too soon render itself independent of American caprice and hostility; and that, without waiting upon the event of the war, every energy should be directed to converting the tropics into cotton fields. In all these things the lecturer is unmistakably right. He only goes wrong, as Englishmen uniformly do either through willfulness, or an ignorance which the national self-conceit renders incurable, when he inquires into American questions, and endeavors to define the issues which separate the loyal from the insurgent States.

Yestesday, an honest countryman, who had traveled from home in a very dilapidated one-horse carl, left his team in front of TIFFANY'S marble palace while he went in to attend to some financial operation with the cashier and junior partner, Mr. ALFRED BEDFORD. He had but begun his story when his [???] was attracted by the sudden disappearance of his vehicle, which, besides being drawn by a $20 horse, contained his only son and heir, aged about ten years. Dropping instantly the matter in hand, he plunged violently through the crowd of astonished customers, shouting "Whoa, Bill, stop I tell you," at the top of his voice. On he went till he reached the doors, which are made of a single pane of plate glass. Never dreaming that any thing less solid than air was before him, he made one final dive, went head foremost against the glass, and landed, cut in forty places, on the pavement. He uttered an exclamation of astonishment, and then remembering "his lost child," ran swiftly up Broadway, until he was stopped by Officer DEVOE, who, imagining him to be a run away thief, arrested and returned him, cut and bleeding, to the store. The poor fellow finally comprehended the matter, but vowed he was never so astonished in the course of his life, which astonishment was somewhat increased when he learned that the cost of the door, which he smashed into a thousand fragments, was $100. His horse, wagon and boy were soon brought safely back, and he went home very much "mixed" in his mental mind as "to them Yorkers and their denied doors with glass in 'em."...</i></div><h2>Articles from 1862 about science</h2><div id="1862_science_0"><h3>GEOGRAPHY AS AN EXACT SCIENCE. <i>(1862-01-24)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1862/01/24/archives/geography-as-an-exact-science.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:The following delicious jumble appears as a leader in the Jamaica Watchman, published at Kingston, W.I.:</div><i>The following delicious jumble appears as a leader in the Jamaica Watchman, published at Kingston, W.I.:...</i></div><div id="1862_science_1"><h3>The Place of the Balloon in Military Science. <i>(1862-07-28)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1862/07/28/archives/the-place-of-the-balloon-in-military-science.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:Role of aeronautical balloons in war discussed; Article on role of aeronautical balloons in military science</div><i>To the Editor of the New-York Times:...</i></div><div id="1862_science_2"><h3>American Geographical Society.; SANITARY SCIENCE BY DR.

It is of paramount importance for the public at the present moment to avoid the two-fold error into which certain superficial thinkers have fallen, of overrating the fiscal burdens incident to our present war, and of underrating the strength we have to bear them. One hundred and fifty millions of dollars is surely an annual contribution for the management of our common Government which twenty millions of willing, energetic, free people, can raise without the smallest difficulty. Were it possible to lay a tax averaging about two cents a clay on every person, the problem would be solved; and none of us are so poor as to feel the pressure of such a burden. Even if double the sum were called for, the overflowing of our prosperity, a few crumbs from the table of luxury, a little thrift and self-denial every day, would be enough to meet the demand....</i></div><div id="1862_science_8"><h3>The Liverpool Chamber of Commerce on Recognition. <i>(1862-11-02)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1862/11/02/archives/the-liverpool-chamber-of-commerce-on-recognition.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:At the meeting of the Council of the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce yesterday, the question of the recognition of the Southern Confederacy came up for discussion.

A brass band was in attendance, and previous to the vocal exercises, enlivened the assemblage with choice selections of music. The rooms, as newly fitted up, present a very comfortable appearance, and are situated in a section of the City quite convenient for our up-town citizens of Democratic tendencies. The National flag was draped in front of the rostrum, and behind it was hung a banner bearing the inscription, "Democratic Union Association of New-York." At 7 1/2 o'clock the meeting was called to order by LUKE F. COZANS, who welcomed the audience to the new rooms, and trusted that they would continue to be the headquarters of a party successful in the future as in the past. He congratulated them on the changed feeling which was now observable in favor of conservatism. He then briefly narrated the rise and progress of the Democratic Union Association, stating what they had done during the past two elections, and the exertions they were determined to make in future to bring the Northern people to a sense of their duty as citizens in this crisis of our country.

On reassembling, the veto massage of the Mayor, on the resolution appointing 162 Commissioners of Deeds, overruled by the Councilmen the day previous, was called up for action. Mr. BOOLE thought the objections of the Mayor were inconsistent, because it would be quite in impracticable matter to settle the legal difficulty respecting the excess of appointments by limiting the number of new appointments. The most feasible plan of adjustment -- and the one which the Common Council would strive to have carried out -- was to have a law passed legalizing the acts of all the appointees. Such a law would set at rest all questions of doubt concerning the acts of Commissioners of Deeds in the City, since their number has exceeded 300. The Board concurred in overruling the veto.

Mr. BAYARD TAYLOR has gained a very extended popularity as a descriptive writer, and some success as a poet, and when it was announced that he had a novel in hand, he was able to claim in advance the suffrages of thousands who were disposed to take on trust anything that might come from his pen. Mr. TAYLOR's novel is at length given to the public, and his warmest admirers are fain to confess a disappointment at the result. Hannah Thurston is a notable illustration of the fact that a man may walk up and down the world, and tell what he sees with good success, and yet lamentably trip when he comes to tread the realms of imagination and attempts to give to airy nothings a local habitation and a name.

For fourteen years the editor, Mr. WELLS, has performed this invaluable service, and the entire series now condenses a greater quantity of sterling matter than any other set of books of equally modest and unassuming pretensions, in the world. There is no English publication that can for a moment stand in comparison with it, for though we believe the idea of the work was originally derived from the London Year Book of Facts, the care and intelligence employed in the preparation of the "Annual," place it at once in a higher class than its predecessor ever aimed to reach. Though the past year has not been distinguished by any one or more discoveries or inventions of surpassing value, yet the active investigations now carrying on in every branch of science and art, offer in their results abundant matter for a record like the present, of great interest and importance. In the first section, "Mechanics and Useful Arts," is given the best summing up we have seen of the actual net gain to science from the English Great International Exhibition of 1862. It is prepared by the Editor from notes taken and material derived during a careful personal inspection and study. Every word of this will repay careful reading. In the same division the article on "Progress of Improvement in War Implements and Constructions," embraces the whole subject of iron-clad ships, rifled cannon, and the other thousand destructive and defensive devices that have taxed the ingenuity of military engineers since LOUIS NAPOLEON and the events of the last two years gave an impetus to the study. In Natural Philosophy, light and heat are the properties or substances that afford the greatest novelties. The splendid discoveries of Prof. KIRCHOFF on the physical condition of the sun and the presence of terrestrial elements in the solar atmosphere are detailed, and his researches on the Solar Spectrum and the spectra of the chemical elements, by which they were arrived at, are fully described. The latest improvements in Photography, celestial and terrestrial, are satisfactorily elucidated, and a careful abstract is given of Prof. TYNDALL's conclusions, drawn from the remarkable facts recently developed tending to show the connection or possible identity of mechanical force and heat. In Chemical Science, "The manufacture of color products from coal-tar," the source of the much admired Mauve and Majenta, and other brilliant hues, is, perhaps, the most interesting article. The editor describes a cylinder of mauve paste, shown by the inventor, Mr. PERKINS, at the Great Exhibition, so small as to be easily carried under one's arm, but which required for its production the tar derived from 2,000 tons of coal. Its value was $4,000, and its "tinctorial potentiality" equal to 100 miles of calico. In "Geology," the recent evidence for the antiquity of man, and in "Zoology," his place and distinct position in the animal kingdom claim most attention, while the discovery in the past year of four new planets (asteroids) and four comets, recorded under "Astronomy," shows that our observers of the heavens have been watchful at their posts.

G.; Elements of the E glish Language; Youmans, Dr. E. L.; Class Book of Chemistry</div><i>Dr. YOUMAN's work on Chemistry has for many years held its own as, perhaps, the very best classbook on the Subject, and in the present edition he brings it up abreast of the latest discoveries in this expansive and expanding branch of science. New views of the nature and connection of the forces have been accepted in the scientific world, which compel a new treatment of this branch of the subject. The old notion that the forces are separate and peculiar forms of imponderable matter, has given way to the idea that they are closely allied and mutually convertible forms of activity or motion in ordinary matter. The older views are held to be self-contradictory, and as they do not explain and cannot represent the present facts of science, they are abandoned by the body of advanced scientific thinkers of the present time. The newer doctrines may be still incomplete, and are not without their difficulties, but they are more simple and rational -- they harmonize with the later facts of discovery, and open many new paths of investigation of the highest interest and promise. Among the latest chemical and physicochemical discoveries embodied by Dr. YOUMANS, in the new edition of the Text Book, are the Spectrum Analysis and the elements discovered by it; Prof. GRAHAM's interesting views of Dialysis and the colloidal condition of matter, and BERTHELOT's remarkable researches in organic synthesis, or the artificial production of organic substances....</i></div><h2>Articles from 1863 about politics</h2><div id="1863_politics_0"><h3>Political. <i>(1863-09-24)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/09/24/archives/political.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:OWEGO, Wednesday, Sept. 23.</div><i>OWEGO, Wednesday, Sept. 23....</i></div><div id="1863_politics_1"><h3>Political. <i>(1863-10-04)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/04/archives/political.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:CORNING, N.Y., Saturday, Oct. 3.</div><i>CORNING, N.Y., Saturday, Oct. 3....</i></div><div id="1863_politics_2"><h3>Political. <i>(1863-10-21)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/21/archives/political.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:BUFFALO, Tuesday, Oct. 20.</div><i>BUFFALO, Tuesday, Oct. 20....</i></div><div id="1863_politics_3"><h3>Political. <i>(1863-10-18)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/18/archives/political.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:SING SING, N.Y., Saturday, Oct. 17.</div><i>SING SING, N.Y., Saturday, Oct. 17....</i></div><div id="1863_politics_4"><h3>Political. <i>(1863-10-17)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/17/archives/political.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:HUDSON, N.Y., Friday, Oct. 16.</div><i>HUDSON, N.Y., Friday, Oct. 16....</i></div><div id="1863_politics_5"><h3>Political. <i>(1863-10-14)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/14/archives/political.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., Tuesday, Oct. 13.</div><i>MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., Tuesday, Oct. 13....</i></div><div id="1863_politics_6"><h3>Political. <i>(1863-10-30)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/30/archives/political.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:STRACUSE, Thursday, Oct. 29.</div><i>STRACUSE, Thursday, Oct. 29....</i></div><div id="1863_politics_7"><h3>The Political Canvass. <i>(1863-10-27)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/10/27/archives/the-political-canvass.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:BUFFALO, Monday, Oct. 26.</div><i>BUFFALO, Monday, Oct. 26....</i></div><div id="1863_politics_8"><h3>Maine Politics. <i>(1863-08-27)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/08/27/archives/maine-politics.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:BOSTON, Wednesday, Aug. 26.</div><i>BOSTON, Wednesday, Aug. 26....</i></div><div id="1863_politics_9"><h3>POLITICAL ITEMS. <i>(1863-11-01)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1863/11/01/archives/political-items.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:-- The Sixth Ohio cavalry voted unanimously for Brought, and this in the face of the enemy under Gen.

C. Church Essays</div><i>The May number of this standard periodical contains an unusual amount of interesting and valuable scientific intelligence. The different papers are quite brief -- and while there is, therefore, a greater variety of subjects discussed, the topics are in general of a popular nature. The leading article is a translation by Baron OSTEN SACKEN, of a lecture on the "Diptera, or Two-winged Insects of the Amber Fauna," delivered some months since at a meeting of the German naturalists in Koenigsberg, by Director LOEW. Herr LOEW sums up hastily in this lecture the results of seventeen years labor in this fascinating field of scientific research, during which time no less than 850 species of Diptera in amber have passed under inspection. It is noted as a remarkable fact that all these specimens belong to the division of the Diptera proboscidea, while, so far, not a single species of the Diptera eproboscidea has been found to occur. Of these 850 species, however, there are only 656 in so complete a state of preservation that their specific characters can be determined with absolute certainty. These are distributed over 101 genera, of which 50, with 395 species, belong to the Diptera nemocera, and 51, with 261 species, to the Diptera brachycera. In the case of the latter, Director LOEW remarks that the chemical decomposition of their larger bodies, the more vigorous resistance which they have made to their entombment in the yet soft resin, the slighter development of their antennae and legs, (organs which furnish such important characters for the ready distinction of the Diptera nemocera.) and still more, the few characteristics points in the neuration of the wings in most of them, for the distinction of species, of genera, and even of famines, all conspire to render the proportion of fragments quite useless for exact determination much greater among the Diptera brachycera than among the Diptera nemocera. If such specimens could be turned to account, the above-mentioned proportion of species would be greatly increased on the side of Diptera brachycera. While the conclusions at which Director LOEW arrives in this article are of high scientific value, the manner in which be discusses the subject gives it a really romantic interest. Prof. H.A. NEWTON, of Yale College, submits the first part of an elaborate paper upon "The Original Accounts of the Displays in former times of the November Star-Shower; together with a Determination of the Length of its Cycle, its Annual Period, and the Probable Orbit of the Group of Bodies around the Sun." A number of curious translations, from ancient writers describing these phenomena as far back as A.D. 902 are given. Mr. JAMES D. WHELPLEY, of Boston, in a letter to Prof. SILLIMAN, which finds a place in the Journal, gives a description of a new process for preparing quartzose ores of gold for amalgamation. The hardest copper ores of Vermont and the quartz of Nova Scotia have been ground in the pulverizing mills described by Mr. WHELPLEY. Among the other papers are contributions to chemistry from the Lawrence Scientific School and from the Sheffield Laboratory of Yale College; a summary of MEISSNER's Researches on Oxygen, Ozone and Antozone; a discussion of Glacial Action about Penobscot Bay, by Dr. LASKI; a description of the Cretaceous and Superior Formations of West Tennessee, by JAMES M. SAEFORD, of Lebanon, and an account of the Influence of Ozone and some other Chemical Agents on Germination and Vegetation. The summary of scientific intelligence is even fuller and more satisfactory than usual, and in every respect the May number of the Journal is the best that we have had for months....</i></div><div id="1864_science_9"><h3>FROM WASHINGTON.; INTERESTING CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS.

It consists of a comb, ear-rings and brooch. The comb is made to represent the twigs, leaves and acorns of the oak tree -- the twigs and leaves being of frosted gold and enamel, and the acorns cut from the wood of the famous, but no longer existing, apple tree at Appomattox Court-house, under which the terms of surrender of LEE's army were agreed upon. The earrings represent two acorns, and the brooch a cluster of leaves and acorns. The effect of the combination is exceedingly good, and the whole design reflects great credit upon the taste of the manufacturers. The same firm have just finished an elegant pipe from the wood of the same tree, mounted in gold, and intended as a present from Mr. HY. K. LIST to Col. WM.B.

Upon the jury taking their seats in the box on Monday, a Quaker who was among their number, kept his hat on. This irregularity disturbed the equanimity of the Judge, Mr. Baron BRAMWELL, and he requested the removal of the hat. The Quaker urged that conscience compelled him to keep it on. The Judge replied that "conscience no more compelled him to keep his hat on than it did his shoes, and that be must have respect for others," and threatened to fine him £10 if he did not take of the hat. "It is a reverence for the Almighty," said the juryman, "which compels me to keep it on." "Don't be nonsensical," retorted the Judge; "your reason is discreditable to common sense." The Quaker persisted, and the Judge at length fined him £10 and ordered him to leave the box. "Any person," he added, "with such nonsense in his head is not fit to sit upon a jury. I shall call upon him again to-morrow, and if he still persists in his nonsense I shall fine him again."...</i></div><h2>Articles from 1865 about technology</h2><div id="1865_technology_0"><h3>The French Exposition, 1867. <i>(1865-12-27)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1865/12/27/archives/the-french-exposition-1867.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:Exposition; Particulars</div><i>We recently called attention to the importance of having our country properly represented at the forthcoming Exposition, and now that Congress has unanimously accepted the invitation of the Imperial Commissioners to participate in the peaceful concert of all nations, we wish to recur again to the subject, and more earnestly than ever impress upon our countrymen the importance of active cooperation....</i></div><div id="1865_technology_1"><h3>NEWS OF THE DAY.; THE REBELLION.

Mr. Gardner, a gentleman well known and highly esteemed, of Fulton, Fulton County, N.Y., has been wasting literally away for the last few years, from Catarrhal Consumption, which produced complete deafness. He himself, as well as his wife, stated that for the last ten years, he had not been able to keep a morsel of food on his stomach, nor to enjoy a single complete night's rest. Perspiration continually stood on his body, as if he were in a vapor bath, being feverish, alternating with a slight chill, characterized by pain in the right side, extending to the point of the shoulder; also a sharp pain of the collar-bone, pain on the right side, particularly causing an uneasy sensation when lying on it, as well as a difficulty in respirating, felt great thirst, his tongue was dry and covered with a white fur; great giddiness and swimming in his head -- in fact he complained of general weakness and disliked movement or exercise, great headache, flatulence, belching, with acid taste in the mouth and throat; he complained of a constant oppression of fullness, and at last his mind showed symptoms of being affected. He also labored under almost complete deafness, and existence became to him a torture. He felt himself wasting away with weakness. As a matter of course, he consulted many physicians of repute, both general practitioners and those practicing specialties, and still he continued to sink; and, as his wife says, after reading the case of consumption in our columns, she and their friends concluded that they could do no better than to apply to the same eminent physician, Dr. Von Eisenberg, one of our practitioners, whose heart is devoted to the cause of suffering humanity. As all hopes of Mr. Gardner's recovery had been given up, there being but little risk, and as a last resource, the husband, wife and friends came to New-York, and called at the Doctor's office, No. 816 Broadway. So much was his nervous system affected, that when he was placed in the examination chair, his countenance seemed to change. A convulsive spasm passed over it, and in a minute or so he seemed to recover, and exclaimed, "Oh, Doctor, you hurt me very much!" although all this time the Doctor had not appreached him. After a careful diagnosis with Dr. Von Eisenberg's usual skill and experience, and after an attentive and patient examination of the history and existing symptoms, the Doctor gave it as his opinion that Mr. Gardner had been suffering from laryngeal phthisis, complicated with dry catarrh; that his deafness arose from the disordered condition of the throat, and in the sympathetic condition between the nerves of the throat and those of the auditory organ. By a minute auscultatory examination of the lungs and laryrnae, he said that pulmonary phthisis may be present, with the usual exciting causes of inflammation and its consequences. Extending to the digestive organ by sympathy and continuity from the pulmonary and digestive mucous surface furnishes many indications, giving rise to heart-burn and acrid eructations, which produce profuse sweating, cough, purulent expectorations. This complication commenced with a dyspeptic character, assuming a severe form, and has been attended by nausea, pain, tenderness, a sense of heat, or burning pain. In fact the Doctor said that in such complicated cases, the commonest catarrh generally appears under a more febrile form, and when it unfortunately affects one of a consumptive tendency, it is the exciting cause of a galloping decay.

The first and extremely well chosen program led off with Charles Moulton, Trisha Brown and David Gordon.   Most of the choreographers are based in New York and some work in other parts of the country, with room provided in the festival for a Minneapolis contingent. Mr. Moulton is a special case, a former dancer in Merce Cunningham's company known in New York as one of the most gifted of the youngest generation of experimentalists, but also hailed here as a native son - having been born and reared in Minneapolis.

For instance, Polish military Government authorities, Solidarity supporters, various Roman Catholic Church representatives, Western governments, including that of the United States, and Western reporters in Poland have all supplied differing assertions on such key questions as the number of Poles killed and detained in the last two weeks, the degree of popular opposition to martial law and the role of the Soviet Union in the crackdown.   The reasons for the discrepancies are many.

The report also said that if science and mathmatics teachers continued to leave the profession at current rates, there would be a 35 percent net loss of such teachers between now and 1992.

White's mounting troubles, with the conviction of city officials and a Federal investigation into municipal corruption here, grow from his creation of an elaborate political machine in the late 1970's after he nearly lost an election, many of his friends and adversaries believe.   The organization, consciously modeled on Mayor Richard J. Daley's machine in Chicago, helped insure Mr. White's re-election in 1979 and remains in place today should he decide to run for a fifth term next fall. Not even James Michael Curley presided over Boston that long.   Mr. White's decision to build his machine marked a critical shift away from an earlier reform-minded policy and opened the door to political operators, ''corner boys'' in Boston parlance, current and former officials say. Grand Jury Investigations   White loyalists were assigned as ward coordinators or precinct captains in the pyramidal machine, given jobs in city government agencies and, according to city employees, given promotions and salary increases according to the number of votes or the size of campaign contributions they delivered. Mayor White himself began addressing his troops at required weekly meetings.

The dimpled smile was craggy, the hair white on the man who began as a liberal mayor of fresh force and imagination in 1968, but whose tone, style and emphasis have changed over the years with his political fortunes.   The 53-year-old Mayor, who came into office as a reformer, overriding the parochial habits of one side of his Irish political ancestry, recruiting talented young administrators, opening City Hall to blacks and Jews, being touted as a future President, is now talked about in Boston as a machine boss, absorbed in fund raising and patronage, surrounded by relatives and addicted to the perquisites he has brought to his office.   It has been a long process with deep roots in the Irish political tradition here, but for Mr. White, the public beginning came in 1960. At the State Democratic Convention in the Boston Arena that year, an unknown young lawyer named Kevin Hagan White contended for the nomination for Secretary of State. His chief strength lay in family, and amid the noise and confusion on the floor, there was a moment of transition, a scene that is remembered today.</div><i>Looking out of his office window one evening last year at the snowy shroud of lights encircling Boston's harbor, Mayor Kevin H.

In such cases, the concern of intelligence agencies that important sources and methods of obtaining intelligence might be compromised has been swept aside by the White House.

Nicaragua's Miskito, Sumo and Rama Indians revolted against the Sandinistas in February 1981, and today their struggle is waged throughout eastern Nicaragua and from Honduras and Costa Rica. The Indians are committed to regaining their territory - most of eastern Nicaragua, which constitutes 38 percent of the national area - and their war will go on until that is achieved, regardless of what government may be in power in Managua.</div><i>The Sandinista Government's recent offer of general amnesty for Miskito Indian prisoners and refugees and its recognition of past policy ''mistakes'' land reform are important conditions for peace negotiations involving the return of Indian land.

Carbide-owned plant in India is

the latest in a series of similar tragedies resulting from the transfer of United States technology to developing countries. 
 Those documented disasters include the deaths in 1972 of 400 to 5,000 Iraqis who consumed unlabeled, mercury-treated grain imported from the United States; the poisoning in 19tk of livestock and workers in Egypt by the pesticide leptophos, and the recent deaths in Mexico City from the explosion of a liquified natural gas facility.  

It is unfortunate that it takes such tragedies to shock the national conscience. ALl of these events require us to examine not only our policies for technology transfer but also our commitment to avoiding serious environmental and occupational health consequences of technology to ourselves or to our foreign clients.

Technology transfer takes the form of exported products, industrial processes and plant, and the skills needed to apply technical ideas. Contrary to some opinion, the bulk of technology transfer does not occur as a result of ''capital flight'' - the relocation of industries to less developed countries for the purpose of escaping the strictures of American environmental and occupational health rules.</div><i>The chemical leak at the Union...</i></div><div id="1984_technology_3"><h3>DESPITE POLITICAL CHILL, U.S.-SOVIET COOPERATION CONTINUES IN SCIENCES <i>(1984-12-25)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/25/science/despite-political-chill-us-soviet-cooperation-continues-in-sciences.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:  Last July, an order for 218 pizzas was radioed to a makeshift Pizza Hut on the dock at Dutch Harbor, Alaska.

It is unfortunate that it takes such tragedies to shock the national conscience. ALl of these events require us to examine not only our policies for technology transfer but also our commitment to avoiding serious environmental and occupational health consequences of technology to ourselves or to our foreign clients.

Technology transfer takes the form of exported products, industrial processes and plant, and the skills needed to apply technical ideas. Contrary to some opinion, the bulk of technology transfer does not occur as a result of ''capital flight'' - the relocation of industries to less developed countries for the purpose of escaping the strictures of American environmental and occupational health rules.</div><i>The chemical leak at the Union...</i></div><div id="1984_science_4"><h3>SCIENCE PARK PLANS EXPANSION <i>(1984-11-25)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/25/nyregion/science-park-plans-expansion.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:SCIENCE PARK is hardly typical of the sprawling suburban industrial park.

For years research on these jets, also known as supersonic-combustion ramjets, has bubbled along in Federal research laboratories on a shoestring budget. Then three weeks ago the President's science adviser and the chief of research and development for the Air Force disclosed that they were ready to commit a half-billion dollars over the next three years to refinement of the engine technology, in hopes of developing a plane that could cross the country in 12 minutes and circle the globe in 90.   If the effort works, it could mark the most significant change in airplane design since the invention of the jet. Air Force officials say scramjets may make it possible for a plane to take off from an ordinary runway and quickly accelerate to Mach 12 or even Mach 25. With the aid of an on-board rocket booster, the plane could even propel itself into orbit, paving the way for a new, less expensive way of launching and retrieving satellites.</div><i>TREMENDOUS progress in the design of a new class of jet engines - known as scramjets - is propelling the fantasy of a hypersonic plane out of the Twilight Zone toward reality....</i></div><div id="1985_technology_5"><h3>  FUNCTIONAL ILLITERACY IN THE AGE OF TECHNOLOGY <i>(1985-12-08)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/08/weekinreview/education-watch-functional-illiteracy-in-the-age-of-technology.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:  IN mathematics and science, according to the National Science Foundation, the United States is in trouble.

Are clones a reality or just a theory?   A. Clones - living genetic copies of an individual organism -have been made of bacteria and other microorganisms, plants, zebra fish, amphibians and other lower forms of life, but the making of human clones remains a fantasy. Clones are derived from a single cell or organism by asexual reproduction. All of the cloned individuals have the same genetic makeup. Gardeners routinely clone plants by cutting, grafting and budding techniques. Many plants that naturally exhibit asexual behavior lend themselves to cloning. However, higher forms of animals do not reproduce asexually. To clone an animal, researchers remove the nucleus in a fertilized egg and replace it with a nucleus taken from another individual. The nucleus must be complete and unaltered and must be able to develop in the egg. Adult frogs have been cloned using this procedure. These frogs were produced by transplanting nuclei from very early frog embryos into fertilized eggs. When nuclei from the cells of adult frogs were transplanted, the clones never developed. This indicates that nuclei from well-developed cells are incapable of replacing those nuclei removed from the fertilized eggs. Because of ethical issues and the extreme difficulty in manipulating mammalian eggs without damaging them, no human has ever been cloned.</div><i>Q....</i></div><div id="1985_science_7"><h3>  HIGH-TECH OPENINGS EXPECTED <i>(1985-12-24)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/24/business/careers-high-tech-openings-expected.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:  THE future of the troubled high-tech industry looks a little brighter for 1986, according to some management recruiters who specialize in high tech.

In the old days, such events weren't covered in these ways. Television viewers would have to wait for the network evening news to hear about a domestic story of widespread interest or an international development like the Iran controversy. But new satellite technology and portable transmission equipment have made it possible for stations in places like Indianapolis, Phoenix, Tampa and Minneapolis to report live directly from Washington or just about anywhere else.

By the early 1980's, the 19-year-old outdoor mall, with wide sidewalks and a buses-only thoroughfare that once made it a model of urban design, had become badly deteriorated. The sidewalks had cracked badly, the electrical snow-melting system had failed and major retailers were closing and moving away, leaving empty storefronts and ''For Rent'' signs in their wake.

''Physically the mall is worn out,'' said Robert Dayton, owner of Harold, a high-fashion women's clothing store on the mall.

St. Paul is the elder sibling, a place of hills and traditions and entrenched neighborhoods. An old river town, it is oriented toward the Mississippi, which is still busy with towboats and barges. On the other bank is Minneapolis, the first of the West, a city born of grain and the need to mill and ship it. A prairie upstart, its flat, neatly gridded streets stretch westward toward the surrounding farmland.

The two cities retain their different flavors still, though relentless urban growth has blurred their borders. The result is a metropolitan area of 2.1 million people, with two downtowns less than 15 minutes apart by highway. On a map, it looks like a double-yolked egg or a binary star. History Both cities trace their roots to a diamond-shaped fortress of gray stone that has guarded the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers since 1820. Fort Snelling, restored and run by the Minnesota Historical Society, is among the best living-history museums in the country. The first American fort west of the Mississippi, it was intended to protect United States interests in the Northwest, and keep peace between the Sioux and Ojibway.</div><i>Twins they are not and never really were, though visitors often think the similarities between Minnesota's green and livable Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul, outweigh their differences....</i></div><div id="1986_Minneapolis_9"><h3>Minneapolis Candidate Freed of Twinkie Charge <i>(1986-06-05)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/05/us/around-the-nation-minneapolis-candidate-freed-of-twinkie-charge.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:  Charges were dismissed today against a 71-year-old City Council candidate who had been accused of handing out $31 worth of Twinkies, Ho Ho's and coffee to elderly voters.

She returned to Taiwan in October to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his birth, and this capital city is full of theories about what she is up to.

The question was raised again last week in a case being considered by the Israeli Supreme Court. The case involves a French Jew, William Nakash, who was convicted in absentia in France of the murder of a French Arab.   Mr. Nakash escaped French justice by fleeing to Israel and becoming a citizen. France asked Israel to extradite him. But Justice Minister Avraham Sharir of the Likud party, contending that he had the discretion to ignore the extradition treaty, ordered Mr. Nakash released. If Mr. Nakash were returned to France, Mr. Sharir argued, he would be a target for Arab revenge in prison. Civil rights activists appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that Israel as a law-abiding nation must hold to its treaty and not harbor Jewish criminals. The court ordered Mr. Nakash held, promising an answer shortly.</div><i>HAS there been a decline in the rule of law in Israel?...</i></div><div id="1986_politics_5"><h3>City Hall: Politics; The Corporate Route To a Government Job <i>(1986-12-22)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/22/nyregion/city-hall-politics-the-corporate-route-to-a-government-job.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:  The more imaginative of New York City's politicians have predicted from the start that the scandals of 1986 would lead to reforms -but nobody expected that corruption would bring the practices of corporate America to City Hall.

Heilmeier, for an invention made nearly 25 years ago: a flat, lightweight video screen on which images can be formed by applying electric current to an organic material called liquid crystal.   At the time of his discovery, Dr. Heilmeier was a young researcher at RCA. But the company quickly gave up efforts to commercialize his invention after determining that it was "more a threat to its existing business than an opportunity," he recalled as he accepted the award.    The Japanese engineers filling the auditorium nodded in silent understanding. Two decades ago many of them had recognized the potential of Dr. Heilmeier's invention. They have built upon it to turn the manufacturing of the video screens, known as flat-panel displays or flat panels, into the cornerstone of a multibillion-dollar Japanese strategy to greatly increase the country's share of the world market for computers and to introduce a host of products.  An Article of Faith     Today it is an article of faith among Japanese manufacturers that by the late 1990's flat panels, barely thicker than a heavy plate of glass, will replace the bulky cathode-ray tube now used in desktop computers. If they are right, Japan will control another essential link in the food chain of high technology. And as the cost of producing the newest of the screens decreases, the biggest names in Japanese electronics are betting that they will be positioned to exploit the technology into everything from high-definition televisions that hang on the wall, to operating-room screens that show surgeons where to cut, to automobile navigation systems that, set into the dashboard, guide drivers to a restaurant or display a shortcut.    The story of how Japan came to dominate what almost every electronics expert agrees is one of the critical computer and video technologies of the 1990's has many familiar elements, and a few surprises. There was patience and persistence, several false starts and years of money-losing research. But the most important may have been Japan's early recognition that learning how to manufacture the screens -- and to manufacture them in enormous volume, for commercial use rather than specialized government and military applications -- was as critical to the future of the technology as the initial breakthrough itself. Marketplace Experiments     If the technology for all this was born at RCA Laboratories, it grew up in places like the Sharp Corporation's manufacturing plants in this ancient Japanese capital. After only three years of tinkering, Sharp decided that the place to experiment was in the marketplace. It installed the first, primitive screens in battery-operated pocket calculators, then in digital wristwatches, clocks and tiny television sets. Now, in much refined form, flat panels are omnipotent not only in those products but also in portable computers, video cameras, compact disk players and medical equipment. "There was such keen competition in calculators that it forced improvements in ways that laboratory research never could," said Atsushi Asada, Sharp's senior executive vice president and its head of research. "We had to make the screens thinner and thinner, more and more compact. This was research by industrialization."   But only in recent years has the work begun to pay off. Liquid crystal's chief advantage is that it requires relatively little electric power, meaning that it can run on batteries. It has taken years, however, to improve sharpness and contrast -- and, most recently, the ability to display thousands of brilliant colors. Now, the big challenges are to make the screens larger, to reduce their power requirements and to manufacture them without defects in enormous volume.  An Ulterior Motive     If the Japanese makers seemed single-minded in their dedication to the technology, they had an ulterior motive. Early on, they intuited that the technology could be parlayed into a huge lead into a new generation of small notebook computers. Those five- to seven-pound machines are Japan's first big hit in the computer business. And while some parts of those systems, including the microprocessors, are made by foreign companies, the panels are the single most expensive component. Not surprisingly in a country that has learned to hoard the highest value-added work for itself, the screens are virtually all produced in Japan.   Sharp alone has made 20 million small liquid-crystal screens this year, and 600,000 large units, including its new color panels. And in the past year the field has exploded here: Matsushita, Hitachi, NEC and a host of lesser-known Japanese companies are in a race to build new plants, all spending at least $100 million a year, in some cases far more. Even a giant American player like the International Business Machines Corporation has been so daunted by the costs and risks of manufacturing large color panels that it created a rare joint venture with a Japanese competitor, Toshiba. The venture is planning to begin production of a color screen next spring. American Entries Unlikely     "Except for some research, almost all of the advanced work is now here," Dr. Heilmeier, now the chief technical officer of Texas Instruments in Dallas, said in Japan. "And the cost of building facilities to produce them is so high that I doubt we are going to see any serious American entries."   Flat panels, of course, are hardly the first critical component to high-technology appliances that Americans invented and then failed to manufacture in high volume. Much the same happened with a critical type of chip, called the charged-couple device or C.C.D., that converts light images into electronic impulses. Developed by Bell Laboratories, it is the key component in video cameras and facsimile machines.   Nor is it the first time Americans have cried foul as Japan virtually overwhelmed the market. A number of small American companies with advanced technology -- many of them developed under contract to the military -- are now foundering in their attempts to manufacture on a large scale. A sense among many investors that the Japanese are too far ahead has thwarted efforts to raise enough money to go into mass production. Unfair Trade Complaint     Several months ago a group of the companies filed a complaint with the United States Government that Japanese makers were selling the screens at artificially low prices to intimidate would-be competitors. But Japanese companies deny the accusation, and they seem likely to find an ally among American computer makers, which depend on Japanese suppliers.   But to those who still view Japanese industry as monolithic, with manufacturers working hand-in-glove with each other and the Government, flat panels are a case study in how much Japanese industry has changed in recent years. While there is one Government-led project to industrialize large-screen displays, thus far it has played little role in the main developments.   Moreover, there has been far more competition than collusion: Japanese companies spent much of the 1970's and 1980's battling each other with competing technologies to build the panels, some betting on tiny light-emitting diodes and others on screens that use electroluminescent gases. But in the past two or three years, that has begun to change. Some makers surged ahead with a technology called active-matrix displays, in which the liquid crystal is placed atop what is essentially a single large computer chip with upward of 1.6 million transistors. Each transistor controls a specific point on the screen, allowing precise images and a huge range of colors. A Huge Scramble     The development has caused a huge scramble, in which companies have all but abandoned years of work to catch up in liquid crystal. "Basically, we are in a panic," said a researcher at a large Japanese company that only recently began pouring money and talent into liquid crystal.   Even those who bet correctly early on, like Sharp and Hitachi, say they still face enormous problems. Chief among them is the disappointing level of their "yields," the number of usable screens that emerge from the processes of manufacturing the giant chips that underlay active-matrix screens. While all companies guard their yield figures zealously, engineers say that for the most complex color screens, only 10 to 20 percent are good enough to sell.    Companies like Toshiba, Hitachi and Matsushita are becoming their own biggest customer for the technology, installing their fanciest screens in a series of luxury products.    The evidence is in towns like Ome, on the outskirts of Tokyo, where Toshiba is making its first laptop computers to use its newly developed, brilliant-color liquid-crystal screens. The computer costs nearly $13,000 in Japan; one of the company's top engineers estimates that $5,000 of that is the price of the screen alone. But the company is betting that, just as it learned how to solve yield and cost problems with memory chips, it will solve them again. From Octopus and Squid     Liquid crystal's existence has been known for more than 100 years. In nature, liquid crystal is produced by octopus and squid, and scientists have toyed with it for decades. But it was 1964 before Dr. Heilmeier and other researchers began to experiment with one of the material's stranger characteristics: By applying an electric current, liquid crystal could be transformed into a type of camera shutter, letting in light when its molecules are standing on end, blocking it when they are twisted horizontally.   That discovery permitted the first liquid crystal displays, with their giant, blocky displays of numbers. But the material was so strange -- and posed enough of a challenge to existing technology -- that Dr. Heilmeier recalls that his colleagues at RCA came up with a long list of reasons to ignore it.   He said the first screens were not silicon, the common material for most microelectronic parts. "They were 'dirty' by semiconductor standards. They were liquids. They were said to be too difficult to make."   But he viewed those more as excuses than compelling logic, and it was those same features that seemed to intrigue the Japanese. "It is a suitable kind of technology for the Japanese mentality," said Shinichi Hirano, an I.B.M. Japan engineer who is overseeing major parts of the alliance with Toshiba. "It was a manufacturing puzzle. I'm not sure American management would wait a quarter of a century" to solve it.   </div><i>A few weeks ago a large Japanese computer maker honored an American scientist and engineer, George H.

Does it hurt living trees to be strung with holiday lights in the winter?     A. Strings of lights do not harm a tree unless it is brought inside in a pot and exposed to warm dry air and then suddenly taken back outside into the cold, or unless the lights are actually hot enough to cause burns, said Jeannie Fernsworth, a horticulturist in the adult education department of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.   Light does affect the growth cycle of trees, she said, but chiefly in combination with temperature changes, which are closely related in nature. In the winter, the outdoor cold has more effect on a dormant deciduous tree than light does, she said.    Leafless groves hung with small white lights, like the one at Tavern on the Green in Central Park in New York City, stay dormant because there are no leaves to absorb the light, she explained. Light will not affect the trees until they are also exposed to the warmer temperatures of spring.    Evergreens will react somewhat to extra light in winter, Ms. Fernsworth said, but they are also more sensitive to temperature, and their processes, like photosynthesis, proceed all year long at a much lower rate than for deciduous trees, with very slow take up of water and transpiration.    "That's why they're evergreens," she said. Pigeons' Bobbing     Q.    Why does a pigeon rock its head back and forth as it walks?     A. What seems like a waste of energy is actually protective, said Todd Culver, an ornithologist with the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y.   As pigeons walk, the head moves forward ahead of the body. It is held still momentarily in relation to the surroundings while the feet move ahead.  This brief pause gives pigeons a clear view of their environment and makes them better able to detect any predators than if their heads were in continuous forward motion, he said. It is as if the pigeons see a series of clear snapshots rather than blurred movie film.   "You can prove this by putting pigeons on a conveyor belt adjusted so they are not going anywhere as they walk," he said. "Lo and behold, they don't bob their heads."</div><i>Lights on Trees Q.

Evergreens will react somewhat to extra light in winter, Ms. Fernsworth said, but they are also more sensitive to temperature, and their processes, like photosynthesis, proceed all year long at a much lower rate than for deciduous trees, with very slow take up of water and transpiration.    "That's why they're evergreens," she said. Pigeons' Bobbing     Q.    Why does a pigeon rock its head back and forth as it walks?     A. What seems like a waste of energy is actually protective, said Todd Culver, an ornithologist with the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in Ithaca, N.Y.   As pigeons walk, the head moves forward ahead of the body. It is held still momentarily in relation to the surroundings while the feet move ahead.  This brief pause gives pigeons a clear view of their environment and makes them better able to detect any predators than if their heads were in continuous forward motion, he said. It is as if the pigeons see a series of clear snapshots rather than blurred movie film.   "You can prove this by putting pigeons on a conveyor belt adjusted so they are not going anywhere as they walk," he said. "Lo and behold, they don't bob their heads."</div><i>Lights on Trees Q.

Deal With Japan Stirs Fear on Competition <i>(1990-12-19)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/19/us/mit-deal-with-japan-stirs-fear-on-competition.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has agreed to teach Japanese scientists how to replicate a laboratory in which researchers are developing futuristic entertainment and education products, touching off an intense debate over scholarship and high technology.    Under the agreement, the Japanese are about to begin an effort to duplicate the creative atmosphere of M.I.T.'s Media Laboratory, which computer experts say is probably the world's only lab in which young scientists are being encouraged to pursue their most creative ideas in merging computers, television and films.   Critics say the $10 million contract is a crass sale of expertise in one of the few areas of computer science in which the Japanese say they are lacking: the ability to build a creative environment to generate new ideas. The critics also say the agreement does not require the Japanese to publish all the results of their research, as M.I.T. does.   But others defend the agreement, saying it is dangerous even to think of taking a protectionist view toward science. They say the university and the world can only benefit by having a Japanese counterpart to the university's media laboratory. Race for High-Definition TV     The research being conducted in the lab offers America what the experts say is its greatest hope in the race with Japan to develop and market high-definition television. Researchers at the lab have also found ways to send movies over telephone lines, instead of over the airwaves or over cable lines, so that instead of going to a video rental store, people will be able to call a number and have a movie transmitted to their television sets.   The researchers have also developed a technique they call interactive television, which allows viewers to use a computer to tailor television shows to their liking, focusing on one item in a news show or selecting a camera angle for a sports event.   Japanese executives speak of products like these when they say they were motivated to buy American movie studios with a goal of merging the technologies of computers, television and films. Last month the Matsushita Electrical Industrial Company bought MCA, owner of Universal Studios, and last year the Sony Corporation bought Columbia Pictures.   Researchers at the media lab say science cannot be restricted by national boundaries. They say that the more media labs, and the more people thinking of such ideas, the better. But critics say the real question is what, besides money, the university and the United States get out of the deal. 2 Japanese Interests     The agreement is between M.I.T. and two Japanese interests: Nihon University and the Japanese industrialist Chiyoji Misawa, a leading builder who is interested in futuristic homes in which computers will control various functions, including regulating temperature, turning lights on and off and opening blinds to let in the sun.   In the debate in the United States, the opposing positions are represented by Pat Choate, an economist who is concerned by Japan's success in acquiring American products, and Andrew Lippman, the associate director of M.I.T.'s media lab.   "Of course it will hurt us," said Dr. Choate. "This kind of knowledge is a major underpinning of our future."   But Dr. Lippman said he believed that the world and American science would be better off if more scientists learned the M.I.T. style. "Right now, it's unfortunate that the media lab is unique in the breadth and scope of what it's doing," he said. "More media labs can only be better." Questions on Competitiveness     Another critic, Dr. Amar Bose, teaches electrical engineering and computer science at M.I.T. He is also founder and director of the Bose Corporation of Framingham, Mass., which designs and produces high-fidelity equipment. "The Japanese recognize that what they are lacking is in the creative side," he said. "They have been unable to develop that side of their economy and they know their future depends on it. So does ours, by the way. They know exactly what they want and they're prepared to go out and buy it.   "If you ask whether this is going to diminish ultimately the U.S. competitive position, the answer is yes."   Seigi Hinata, a spokesman at the Japanese Consulate in New York, agreed that the Japanese were developing basic research. "Up to now Japan has excelled in applying results of European and U.S. basic research," Mr. Hinata said. "But now we are beginning to put an emphasis on producing world-class research that will break new ground."    While the agreement was actually reached in 1987, it has not been publicized, even within the university. And the Japanese officials involved in the project only recently obtained the building permits needed to start work on the media laboratory in Japan, although a small lab has been in operation so some research techniques could be learned. Details on Contract     M.I.T. officials say the university will get nothing tangible, other than the $10 million, and they acknowledge that the agreement does not require the Japanese to publish all their results. "I don't know if M.I.T. gets anything out of it other than money," said Dr. Kenneth A. Smith, vice president for research at the university.   But Dr. Smith cautioned that he was not certain that a media lab like M.I.T.'s could be transplanted.   Dr. Nicholas Negroponte, founder and director of the media lab, said that under the terms of the agreement he could not release a copy of the contract without permission from the Japanese. But he agreed in a recent interview to discuss the arrangement.   Dr. Negroponte said the Japanese would pay M.I.T. the $10 million over five years. The money will go into M.I.T.'s $1.6 billion endowment, but in an informal arrangement, the money will be used to support the media lab.   So far, as part of the agreement, three Japanese scientists have spent a year each at M.I.T., learning the culture of the media lab and how to run a lab like it. In addition, Dr. Negroponte said, virtually every one of the 19 professors at the M.I.T. lab has gone to Japan and looked in on what he said was the "small prototype" of the lab that was created while the Japanese waited for permission to build the real thing. Future Help From M.I.T.     Two graduates of the M.I.T. media lab were hired this year to help start the Japanese laboratory, which is to be built in Chiba prefecture east of Tokyo. Once the new lab opens, M.I.T. researchers and students will regularly spend time there, the agreement said.   M.I.T.'s Media Laboratory is a fairly new venture, having opened in 1985. Timothy Browne, who had worked for the lab and now manages an interactive television project for McCann-Erickson World Wide, an advertising agency, said the media lab is dissimilar to any Japanese lab. "There are a lot of wild kids who are given a lot of responsibility and authority," he said of the researchers. "Stereos are blaring and there is a lot of laughter. Japanese labs are considerably more serious, and the researchers themselves aren't given that kind of responsibility and authority."   Dr. Negroponte said it costs $10 million a year to operate the media lab and that $9 million of this was provided by the Federal Government and private companies. The Government pays about 30 percent, he said. About 15 percent of the corporate money is provided by Japanese firms under previous agreements, Dr. Negroponte said.   The $10 million that the Japanese agreed to pay under the new contract is enormously important as a source of funds, Dr. Negroponte said. Asked what else is in the arrangement for M.I.T., he replied, "You mean the money isn't enough?"   Some experts say they have mixed feelings about the agreement, adding that their reaction would be determined by what the United States got out of the deal. A Two-Way Flow?     "It's really a hard call," said Dr. Joseph Nye, the director of the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University. "The critical question is whether there is a two-way flow."   But others say that from what they have heard, M.I.T.'s agreement may seriously harm American competitiveness.   "The Japanese are moving toward the year 2000 to have a research and development capacity that is equal to or greater than that of the U.S.," Dr. Choate said. "The Japanese intend to dominate us."   Making their own version of the media lab "is an integral step," he added.   Dr. Choate said that the Japanese arrangement makes him question whether it is wise for industries to invest in M.I.T. "The fact that M.I.T. is peddling off its media lab should be of great concern," he said.   Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategies Institute, a research organization in Washington, said: "I can't imagine Japan doing a similar kind of deal. It seems to me that we typically undervalue what we have."</div><i>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has agreed to teach Japanese scientists how to replicate a laboratory in which researchers are developing futuristic entertainment and education products, touching off an intense debate over scholarship and high technology....</i></div><h2>Articles from 1990 about politics</h2><div id="1990_politics_0"><h3>Political Memo; A Year in Sound Bites: 10 Seconds to Remember <i>(1990-12-31)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/31/us/political-memo-a-year-in-sound-bites-10-seconds-to-remember.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:  It was a year when President Bush moved from "no new taxes" to "tax revenue increases" to a strange request to "read my hips."

Bennett backed out of his agreement to become chairman of the Republican National Committee he was walking away from one of the biggest headaches in American politics right now.    The Republican Party is rife with problems that have long been associated with the Democrats: ideological schisms, personal bickering, pique parading as principle and individual agendas undermining party unity.   There is rising concern among Republicans around the country that at a time when the White House should be pulling the party together, the President is distracted by a range of foreign crises and his chief of staff, John H. Sununu, is more concerned with settling grudges with other powerful Republicans.   The absence of Lee Atwater, the party chief who is suffering from an inoperable brain tumor, has become glaringly apparent, many Republicans now say. Mr. Sununu has tried to consolidate the jobs of chief of staff and chief political adviser. This would be difficult for even the most light-footed of operatives. But politically minded Republicans say it has created nothing but grief under Mr. Sununu, who walks across political minefields with all the grace of a raging elephant.   Friends insist Mr. Bennett was telling the truth when he announced he could not succed Mr. Atwater because his concerns about conflict of interest would keep him from making as much money as he needed. But they also said that he had long discussions with associates about the seriousness of the party's internal divisions, and that this did nothing to encourage him to overcome the financial obstacles.   Indeed, officials in Mr. Sununu's office say they offered to more than double the chairman's salary, to $300,000, to entice Mr. Bennett. But that was said to be less than half of what he could make from speaking fees. So he walked away sending a letter of explanation to the President and holding a news conference in the White House driveway that only added to the sense that the Republican camp is in disarray.   "I would not characterize it as chaos," said Eddie Mahe, who helped run the Republican National Committee when Mr. Bush was its chairman. "But it surely could be characterized as confusion. There is no shining beacon on any hill that all forces are moving toward. It's just a mumbo jumbo of forces on a plain."   Some of the current problem goes to the very core of the party. Two of the bonding agents of the Republican coalition, opposition to communism and opposition to taxes, have been weakened, one as a result of world events and the other as a result of White House handling of the budget negotiations.    On top of these philosophical problems, and in several cases because of them, Washington is being treated to a series of Republican feuds of a sort remarkable even by Washington's standards of pigue, backbiting and infighting.   Some news from the battlefield:   *Two of the party's best known conservatives, Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development who was a Presidential candidate in 1988, and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip who hopes to be the next Republican leader of the House, openly rebelled against Mr. Bush's decision to raise taxes to get a budget deal with Democrats and are still battling the White House over domestic policy.   *Conservatives of various stripes are talking about a challenge to Mr. Bush for the 1992 Presidential nomination. Pete duPont, the former Delaware Governor and another candidate for the Republican nomination in 1988, is setting up a political committee that some conservatives hope will serve as a vehicle for another Presidential campaign. Aides to Mr. duPont say these are pipe dreams of frustrated conservatives.   *Mr. Sununu is barely on speaking terms with Mr. Gingrich and, in a seperate feud, has blocked the President from signing fund-raising letters on behalf of the House Republican Campaign Committee so long as Edward J. Rollins, one of the Republican Party's most outspoken political strategists, is in charge. Mr. Rollins's offense was to suggest during the midterm campaigns that Republican candidates should separate themselves from Mr. Bush's flip-flops on taxes.   The grumbling on the right has become so loud that one Republican entrepreneur has even carved out a successful market by selling buttons with the message, "Dan Quayle now."    So far, most of this is of fascination to a few thousand political insiders. But Republican operatives fear that the confusion is beginning to plant doubts in the public mind about the competence of the President. That would be nothing more than an irritant if the economy, that great mover of public opinion, were headed up. But it is the last thing Mr. Bush needs as the economy heads down, dragging the President's political standing with it. An Old Argument in New Light     Mr. Bush took a list of potential party chairmen to Camp David this weekend. But some Republicans say that what may be more important is who he names to run his re-election campaign. That is the person who will probably emerge as chief political adviser and will provide the counterweight to Mr. Sununu that has been missing since Mr. Atwater became ill.   Some of what is going on is a battle for control of the domestic policy agenda. "We are in the middle of an argument which a lot of us thought ended in 1989," Mr. Gingrich said. "There really is a fundemental difference between the managerial/accommodationist approach to the welfare state and the reform/replacement approach."   Ideological conservatives like Mr. Gingrich would like the White House to champion a program of low taxes, curtailed bureaucracy, freer markets and the use of Federal funds to increase individual choices in areas like education.   A White House conservative, Jim Pinkerton, called this program "the new paradigm" for a post-New Deal conservative agenda. That led to an inside battle when the budget director, Richard G. Darman, seemed to make fun of the idea in a recent speech. Mr. Gingrich, a proponent of Mr. Pinkerton's thesis, said Mr. Darman should be dismissed if he did not embrace the effort to forge a new conservative agenda.   Mr. Darman and Mr. Gingrich have held about 12 hours of meetings since their blow-up, Mr. Gingrich's staff reports. The mood between the two men is said to be better now, and Mr. Gingrich's camp at least credits Mr. Darman with showing enough respect for the new paradigmists to debate their ideas.   But the big test, the conservatives say, will be what Mr. Bush says in his budget and State of the Union Message about domestic policy. Mr. Sununu tried to address some of that in a speech this week, saying that whether it was called the new paradigm or something else the cornerstone of Mr. Bush's domestic policy was the encouragement of capitalism and the expansion of free markets.</div><i>When William J.

Although best known as a refrigerant and as a blowing agent in plastic-foam production, the family of chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons is widely used to clean newly soldered electronic circuit boards. But CFC's, as they are generally known, have been linked to the degradation of the earth's protective ozone layer. Production Is Ending    By international agreement, CFC production is to be phased out by the end of the century. And that deadline may well move up as political leaders respond to environmental concerns and to mounting evidence of the adverse effect of CFC's on the atmosphere.

The shift has accelerated since the watershed events of February 1990, when President F. W. de Klerk legalized the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups, freed Nelson Mandela from prison and promised to end white domination. The new politics of power sharing were evident at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, as the negotiating forum is titled, which began Friday and wound up its first session on Saturday.   Mr. de Klerk offered to negotiate a multi-racial interim government in place of the white rule of the last 43 years. Mr. Mandela, speaking for the African National Congress, predicted that a new Constitution could be in place by Christmas next year.   In what may have been a harbinger of the future, a white police major and a black former guerrilla jointly supervised the convention's security arrangements. Other old enemies worked, ate and drank together. They will continue cooperating in five working groups created to thrash out differences before the convention reconvenes, probably in March. Friends From Prison    "I see all my old friends from Robben Island and Pretoria Central," said Helen Suzman, a veteran human-rights campaigner who attended the convention as a delegate of the liberal Democratic Party. Mrs. Suzman referred to the political prisoners, including Mr. Mandela, for whose welfare she battled so many years. They were rubbing shoulders with politicians of the Government that locked them up.   It took an ugly public argument Friday night between President de Klerk and Mr. Mandela, over the African National Congress's refusal to disband its guerrilla wing, to drive home the reality of political organizations who find themselves now together but dreaming different dreams.   For decades, the battle lines in South Africa were racially drawn between whites defending minority domination and blacks demanding equality. Today, alliances have been recast, dividing those pledged to negotiate a peaceful solution from those who see even talking as a sellout.   The National Party cannot hope to bridge its schism with the Conservative Party, whose founders broke away in 1982 at the prospect of reform. White Afrikaners lead both parties and sit together in Parliament. But right-wingers like those in the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement threaten civil war if Mr. de Klerk gives blacks the kind of political equality discussed at the convention. Splits in Anti-Apartheid Camp    And the African National Congress is estranged from two smaller black movements, the Pan-Africanist Congress and the Azanian People's Organization, who fought a common struggle against apartheid and now say the African National Congress betrayed blacks by talking to the Government. The Azanian People's Organization, a black consciousness group, balked in October at joining a united front against the Government at the negotiating table. The Pan-Africanists dropped out last month, accusing the African National Congress of colluding with the Government to share power.   The Conservative Party, the Pan-Africanist Congress and other parties that refused to attend the convention gamble that the talks will falter at racially charged impasses. The hard-liners have gained support from defectors leaving the National Party and the African National Congress because of their willingness to compromise.   The Inkatha Freedom Party, a Zulu-based movement, was viewed as a Government ally, if not collaborator, after receiving secret Government subsidies to compete with the African National Congress. Yet Inkatha's leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, boycotted the political convention, which the Government also paid for, because the Zulu King, Goodwill Zelethini, was not allowed a separate seat. Inkatha attended but refused to sign a declaration supported by the Government. To reinforce the paradox, Inkatha has talked with the Conservatives, who speak of Afrikaners and Zulus as proud nations similarly entitled to self-determination. Suspicion Persists    Though the National Party and the African National Congress have emerged as the principal negotiating partners, mutual trust remains fragile, with each party suspicious that the other nurtures a hidden agenda.   Mr. Mandela and other congress officials have said that the Nationalists seek to perpetuate white privilege under another guise. Mr. de Klerk's Government and the National Party accuse the congress of wanting to impose unworkable Marxist panaceas.   The disagreements extend to their definitions of progress. The congress wants an interim government installed within 18 months and a new constitution drafted by an elected constituent assembly. The National Party envisions a transitional government lasting at least 10 years, according to the Minister of Constitutional Development, Gerrit Viljoen, and it wants the Constitution negotiated.    Such differences portend hard negotiations. Yet the journey to a democratic future has begun, dividing South Africans into those embarking on the uncertain trek and those who choose to stay behind.</div><i>The beginning of negotiations on a non-racial future for South Africa has underscored the extent of a political shift here -- from a preoccupation with racial exclusion to a more complex concern over how blacks and whites, long divided by apartheid, can survive in a shared system....</i></div><div id="1991_politics_4"><h3>Political Move Long Ago Led to Miller Conviction <i>(1991-12-15)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/15/nyregion/political-move-long-ago-led-to-miller-conviction.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:  More than a half-dozen years ago, in the cauldron of Brooklyn Democratic politics, Mel Miller made a routine decision to back State Senator Martin Markowitz in his race for borough president.

The mercurial quality of the Weisman Museum, which opened three weeks ago, isn't solely due to the quicksilver reflections of light that constantly play over its gleaming stainless steel facade. Nor is it just a matter of the mutable images -- a fish, an ice palace, Rapunzel's tower -- fleetingly evoked by the facade's flaring, curving facets. It arises, rather, from an idea about art and its place in the contemporary scheme of things. This is Frank Gehry's first art museum. He has designed some brilliant museum installations over the years, and his Temporary Contemporary, a converted industrial shed, remains one of downtown Los Angeles's enduring joys.

The metro government's priority, the new charter states, will be less to provide regional services than to manage the region's growth, which has been exploding.

Virtually every national hotel chain is represented in a few square miles, sometimes more than once. But until three years ago, the local Holiday Inn was "a dump," says Jim Saccoman, the general manager. Then the owners, an investment group based in Chicago, hired the Minneapolis architect James Dayton, whose projects include the new McPhail Center for the Arts, to redo the building. Mr. Dayton added a sleek metal awning out front -- signaling that contemporary architecture had arrived -- and revamped the interiors, giving them the look of a boutique hotel. If it is surprising that the owners of a Holiday Inn near the mall would try to emulate a "W," it is even more surprising that, for the most part, they have succeeded....</i></div><div id="2005_Minneapolis_2"><h3>Home Delivery <i>(2005-10-09)</i></h3><div>The original article: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/09/style/tmagazine/home-delivery.html">here.</a></div><div>Abstract:Thanks to good design, prefabricated houses are finally getting respect.</div><i>Most people associate prefabricated houses with those "Wide Load" ranches on the back of a truck whizzing down the interstate.

There's even an exhibition devoted to them - "Some Assembly Required: Contemporary Prefabricated Houses" - opening Dec. 11 at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.

Yesterday the Minneapolis Institute of Arts announced that he had been appointed its director and president. Mr. Griswold succeeds Evan Maurer, who retired in February for health reasons. Before becoming acting director of the Getty in October, Mr. Griswold had been the museum's associate director responsible for curatorial, conservation, exhibition and education departments. As soon as the museum world learned that he had decided not to go for the Getty's top job, his name was bandied about for several other available museum director openings, including the job held by Katharine Lee Reid, who is retiring from the Cleveland Museum of Art at the end of the year.

Even today, the words "Minnesota winter" send, well, shivers, as well they might, with the average temperature last month at around 13 degrees. But in Minneapolis it has all become bearable with the advent of polyester fibers, seven miles of glass-enclosed interlocking skyways that connect downtown buildings and an art and theater scene that doesn't stop percolating just because the ice is two feet thick on the Lake of the Isles, where the former Vice President Walter Mondale can be seen daily walking his dog, come rain or blizzard. The favorite pastime in the Minneapolis winter is to quit your whining and go outside and play.

Since 1989, more than 30 American metropolitan regions have developed or expanded their light-rail and commuter-rail systems, while some have built bus rapid-transit lines. Many of these new services provide airport connections, including ones that serve Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International. The Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, for instance, has been linked since 2000 by the Trinity Railway Express to the center of Dallas (35-minute ride, $4.50 each way), and since 2002 to Fort Worth (31 minutes, $2.50 each way). The Trinity trains run about twice an hour during peak commuting times in the morning and afternoon, and hourly at other times. The airport station can be reached by a shuttle bus from all terminals. Information is available at trinityrailwayexpress.org/newweekeb.html. Figuring out whether rapid transit works for you should take about five minutes on the Internet. Use the search term “ground transportation” and the airport you are visiting. All major airport Web sites publish instructions with maps about how to get to train stations. The sites also link to the local public-transit agency that operates the service and provide details about routes, schedules and fares. If you are carrying a lot of bags, a shuttle bus, taxi or rental car generally makes more sense even though they cost more than trains. During morning and afternoon rush hours, these more conventional methods can also take considerably longer. But if you are carrying only an overnight bag, a laptop and a briefcase, the train is competitive. Here are six cities that make the transit connection convenient. Boston Logan International Airport has two rapid transit lines to get downtown and to many suburbs, a rapid-transit bus line and a subway. Two years ago, the airport and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority opened the Silver Line rapid-transit bus service on a dedicated right of way from Logan to South Station downtown, which connects to commuter rail, Amtrak, intercity bus service and the Red Line subway to Cambridge and other communities. The bus stops three times in the city, serves all five Logan terminals, costs $1.25 a ride and takes about 20 minutes. A taxi takes much longer during rush hours and costs $25 to $30. Logan is also served by the Blue Line subway, reachable on a free shuttle bus that runs regularly all day and serves every terminal. The Blue Line intersects the Orange Line at the State Street station (three stops) and the Green Line at Government Center (four stops). The one-way fare is $2, and travelers typically can make the total trip, airplane to city destination, in 40 minutes to an hour, better than contending with Boston traffic, especially at peak times. For more information, go to mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/. PhiladelphiaThe Philadelphia International Airport is served by a commuter-rail line that connects all seven terminals to center city. Since the service started in 1985, 20 million passengers have used the R1 high-speed train to get to and from the airport. Trains run every 30 minutes from 5 a.m. to midnight, and take about 20 to 30 minutes to reach three downtown stations that connect with Amtrak and Philadelphia’s extensive subway and commuter-rail system. The one-way fare is $7 or $8 on the train (a taxi costs about $30), and tickets may be bought from the conductor. Additional information is at septa.org/service/sched/pdfs/R1Airport.pdf. Chicago The Chicago Transit Authority operates the Blue Line subway 24 hours a day from O’Hare International Airport to downtown Chicago. The authority also operates the Orange Line to Midway Airport. One drawback to taking the train to the city from O’Hare is that the Blue Line station is tricky to find. Follow the signs to the O’Hare C.T.A. station, which is on the lowest level of the parking garage in the main terminal area. One advantage, however, of taking the train from O’Hare is that it runs every 10 minutes during the day, and takes around 45 minutes. The Orange Line station at Midway is a 10-minute walk from the main terminal. Trains operate 21 hours a day during the week, every six to eight minutes during peak times, and take about 30 minutes to make the 121/2-mile trip downtown. The fare from O’Hare and Midway is $2 each way and could climb at peak times pending budget negotiations. Average taxi fare from O’Hare to downtown is $35 to $40, and from Midway $25 to $30. The Web site for the Blue Line is transitchicago.com/maps/rail/blue/OHare.pdf. For the Orange Line, transitchicago.com/maps/rail/orange/Midway.pdf. San FranciscoThe Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system has been serving San Francisco International Airport since June 2003 with fast, frequent trains. BART trains stop at a station in Garage G, which is reachable on the airport’s AirTrain system, an automated people mover that connects terminals with airport services. Its trains run all day, as often as every four minutes. BART operates from the airport from 4 a.m. to nearly midnight during the week. It takes 23 to 33 minutes to reach all San Francisco stations, which connect to four other lines and 37 more stations in the 104-mile system. One-way fares vary by destination, though they are generally in the $5 range. For schedules and a BART map, see bart.gov/stations/schedules/lineSchedules.asp. For fares, bart.gov/tickets/calculator/fareCalculator.asp. WashingtonRonald Reagan Washington National Airport, which lies just across the Potomac River from downtown Washington, is served by the Blue and Yellow Lines of the city’s Metrorail, one of the most modern and elegant rapid-transit systems in the world. Trains operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority run every few minutes from 5 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., and to 3:30 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. The 106-mile, 86-station Metro system serves Washington and Virginia and Maryland suburbs. The trip from Reagan National to downtown on the Yellow Line, which is more direct, takes 10 to 15 minutes, depending on your stop. There is no faster way to get downtown. On the Blue Line, which serves more stations on the Virginia side of the river, trips downtown can take 15 to 24 minutes. Fares to center-city stations vary, but are generally around $2 each way. Tickets can be bought at dedicated vending machines at the airport Metro station, in front of the main terminal. The Web site for the Metro’s map is wmata.com/metrorail/systemmap.cfm. For schedules, wmata.com/timetables/rail/Midday.pdf. MinneapolisThe Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport is connected to downtown Minneapolis by the Hiawatha light-rail line. Trains run every 10 minutes during much of the day. The trip takes 25 minutes and costs $2 each way. Trams connect passengers to light-rail stations at two airport terminals, though this year one of the Hiawatha Light Rail stations is closed for construction at the Humphrey Terminal.

He and his colleagues compared the genome sequences of 19 wolves, 25 village dogs descended from indigenous dogs, and 46 domesticated dogs belonging to 34 breeds. Village dogs were more genetically diverse than domesticated dogs, and wolves were the most diverse of all.
